# Getting started

## Install Elm

[Elm Guide - Getting stated](https://guide.elm-lang.org/get_started.html)

TL;DR: `npm install -g elm`

## Install the Elm svn package

`$ elm package install elm-lang/svg`

```bash
To install elm-lang/svg I would like to add the following
dependency to elm-package.json:

    "elm-lang/svg": "1.1.1 <= v < 2.0.0"

May I add that to elm-package.json for you? [Y/n]

Some new packages are needed. Here is the upgrade plan.

  Install:
    elm-lang/core 4.0.5
    elm-lang/html 1.1.0
    elm-lang/svg 1.1.1
    elm-lang/virtual-dom 1.1.1

Do you approve of this plan? [Y/n]
